### README ###

# #Use this script for analyses of all reads that align to a region of interest from DiMeLo-seq in vivo or in situ, for plotting aggregate mA/A,
# also outputs nucleosome density within rolling window for region of reads that map within the window.
# Input - hybrid Guppy + winnowmap bams processed to csv files (that are output from DiMeLoseq_in_situ_roi_single_molecule_v7_q10.py) containing the following:
# ReadID | array of NaN's or probability score of methylation where, NaN ==> non-A basepair position or not covered, probability score 0 - 255

# First part of the code reads in csv file, calculates average mA/A (with binning for ex. by averaging over 1kb rolling window for better visualization),
# calculates coverage (number of reads aligned to each base position inferred from A positions i.e. non-NaNs in input csv), plots the results

# Second part of the code uses the following formula to bin methylation probability scores
# p(at least 1 mA) = 1 - product(1-p(mA)) where product is calculated over all elements of rolling bin
# then, bins that satisfy the condition p(at least 1 mA) > 0.9 is considered as a methylated bin
# nucleosome density within a rolling 5kb window is then calcuated as (total number of methylated bins)/200 (assuming 200 bp maximum footprint of a nucleosome)
# For the nucleosome density measurements, only reads that map to > 1kb within a given rolling window is considered
# This part of the code plots mean nucleosome density at each rolling 5kb window


### The following filepaths and variables need to be updated for running the script

#Insert barcode name (to iterate over different barcodes)
#Insert modification - 'A' and/or 'C'
#for example:
mod = ['A']
Barcode_name = {18:'CA'}
filename_prob = <filepath> + str(Barcode_name[i]) + '_' + str('A') + '_prob.csv'
i = 18 #alternately, iterate over multiple barcodes where required
j = 'A' #alternately, iterate over 'A' and 'C' where required

outfolder = <output_directory_path>

#Variables to update for part 1
thr_raw = 230 #Threshold of p(mA) for aggregate mA/A plots, 0-255

#Variables to update for part 2.
# change bin size and threshold for p(at least 1 mA within bin) for nucleosome density measurements
prob_bin_size = 130 #number of bp to be considered for rolling window while binning
thr = 0.9 #threshold of p(at least 1 mA)


#Update the following variables for calcualting and plotting nucleosome density for a region of interest (0 - size of chromosome region of interest)
roi_start = 0 
roi_end = window[1]-window[0]

#update the following variables for different rolling window size and step sizes, as well as minimum read alignment 
#for calculating and plotting nucleosome density
rolling_window_size = 5000 
step_size = 2500 #Make sure this is smaller than window size
minimum_coverage = 1000 #Make sure this is smaller than window size

## Enter the correct bed start, bed end and windowsize (same as in the script used to generate the input csv file) info below
#for example:
Chromosome_Region = 'ChrX_CDR_300kb_5745_5775'
bedstart = 57450000
bedend = 57750000
windowsize = 150000

import numpy as np
import math

windowstart = math.floor((bedstart+bedend)/2-windowsize)
windowend = math.floor((bedstart+bedend)/2+windowsize)
#window = (int(windowstart), int(windowend))
#Alternately, provide window as a subset of the total window:
window = (int(windowstart),int(windowend)-50000)
