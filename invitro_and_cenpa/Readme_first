### READ ME FIRST ###

#This readme file contains information on how to use the files in the invitro_and_cenpa subfolder. Files in this folder were used to generate subfigures in figure 2, figure 6 and extended data figures 1,2,10 in DiMeLo-seq manuscript (Altemose et al 2022 Nature Methods)

### Description of files:

## Figure 2 and Extended Data Figures 1,2 (in vitro DiMeLo-seq):

# DiMeLoseq_in_vitro_fastq_to_length_filtered_bam.sh

#bash script for processing fastq output of Megalodon/Guppy to make length filtered bam files. (filtering out reads > 3.6 kb ==> reads containing the full 18x601 array sequence)

# DiMeLo_1X601_730bp_CA_Array_ModProbStats_031622_Git.ipynb
# DiMeLoseq_Trial4_CA_Array_ModProbStats_2022.03.22_Git

#jupyter notebooks for (i) plotting histogram of mA/A for all reads, (ii) plotting mA/read for all positions along template, (iii) sensitivity measurements on 1x601 chromatin, (iv) clustermaps and nucleosome counting on 18x601 chromatin. Uses length filtered bam as input.
#(Trial4 - 18x601 library)

## Figure 6 and Extended Data Figure 10 (in situ CENP-A DiMeLo-seq):

# DiMeLoseq_in_situ_CENPA_kmer_mA.ipynb

#Jupyter python notebook showing example script for plotting mA/A histogram for all libraries and subsets of reads in libraries (subset based on presence of CENP-A-enriched-kmer). Takes Guppy or Megalodon generated bam with modified base calls as input.

# DiMeLoseq_in_situ_CENPA_kmer_mA_plotting.ipynb

#Jupyter python notebook for plotting mA/A results from DiMeLoseq_in_situ_CENPA_kmer_mA.ipynb

# single_molecule_roi_winnow_guppy_noquart_ChrX_CDR_300kb_5745-5774_final_v7_q10_revFlip.rawProbs.py

#python script for extracting reference position adjusted mA probability arrays for reads that map to specific region of genome (specified in bed file) for a given library from Guppy+Winnowmap generated hybrid bam files. Outputs csv containing read ID and array of mA probability scores (or NaNs for non A's and non-covered regions of the region of interest) for reads that align within -windowsize to +windowsize around the midpoint of bed file.

# DiMeLoseq_guppy_winnowmap_ChrX_CDR_300kb_5745_5775_2022.03.22_Git

#Jupyter python notebook showing example for plotting aggregate mA/A and CENP-A nucleosome density for a specified region of the genome from csv file generated by single_molecule_roi_winnow_guppy_noquart_ChrX_CDR_300kb_5745-5774_final_v7_q10_revFlip.rawProbs.py.
